    <h1>About me</h1>    
    <p>Hi! I'm runarcn (he/him), a music student and among other things free time FOSS advocate. I currently live near Trondheim, Norway. In my free time I enjoy playing chess, programming, reading and watching series. Sometimes I also write <a href="/blog">blogs</a>, both here and on <a href="https://runarcn.substack.com/">Substack</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I made this website as a passion project to learn more about HTML, CSS and git. If you want to view the source code there's a link at the bottom of this page. Naturally, everything is free software and licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While a webpage is useful for a lot of stuff, it's not the best way for someone to get to know me. Therefore, if you want to ask me anything, have a chat or whatever, head over to my <a href="/links.hmtl">links</a> page and shoot me a DM wherever you like. You'll also find my Lichess page if you want to play chess.</p>
