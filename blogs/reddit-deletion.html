    <h1>Why I'm deleting my all my reddit content, and how you can do the same.</h1>
    <p>Following the reddit API changes and reddit blackout, many people have decided to automatically delete all their content from reddit. This here is why I'm doing the same, how you can do the same, and reddit's shady practice when it comes to the GDPR and the Right to be Forgotten.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why I'm deleting my content from reddit.</h2>
    <p>I've been on reddit from quite some time now, 5 years to be exact. It's been an amazing time with a great community. One of the big benefits to reddit that seemingly no other platform has, is how you can find any kind of nich√© content there and interact with people who have an interest for it and learn basically anything.</p>
    <p>Wanna watch cute animals on r/eyebleach? Go ahead. Is your thing more specifically retro gaming on a raspberry pi? r/retropie has got your back. You've even got beer specifically from New Orleans (r/neworleansbeer) and countless weird and specific NSFW subreddits (which were all highly prominent in the reddit blackout, respect!) if what you're looking for is an uberspecific kind of kink.</p>
    <p>This community and it's curation of posts via awards, comments, upvotes and downvotes is what made the website so valuable. In fact, many people began adding "site:reddit.com" to their web searches because they knew they'd get good results like that; there was <i>always</i> a reddit community or post to help you out.</p>
    <p>Sadly, these communities are now dying out. The higher-ups at reddit inc. seemingly doesn't understand that this is what gives the website it's value and are now fucking over everything. They're spreading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/14dkqrw/i_want_to_debunk_reddits_claims_and_talk_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" misinformation</a> about reddit developers, allegedly <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14ebl7k/umodcodeofconduct_admin_account_caught_quietly/">un-marking NSFW subs</a> and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14ahqjo/mods_will_be_removed_one_way_or_another_spez/">forcing</a> their volunteer workforce to stop protesting against their actions in completely fair ways. And personally, I've had it.</p>
    <p>About 6 months ago, I made my account on Mastodon and got introduced to the Fedivsere. Here, there was no central owner like reddit has. Instead there was only the communities and their own moderators. No ads, no tracking, no corpo bullshit. Only your own content and memories - not as some Big Tech data, but as exactly your own content and memories. Reddit doesn't give a shit about that. They only think of you as data for their own profit.</p>
    <p>Personally, I'm pretty fucking tired of social media apps pulling movies like this. Facebook <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">messed</a> with the 2016 election and performed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users">psychological</a> experiments on their users. They also own Instagram. TikTok stores your information in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2023/05/30/tiktok-creators-data-security-china/">China</a> where the CCP abuses it. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7vmm4/tech-companies-wont-say-abortion-data-roe-v-wade?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20220627&instance_id=65127&nl=dealbook&regi_id=188241515&segment_id=96903&te=1&user_id=92af5bb2f1895b2a69cc0b0a4026ca43">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/police-getting-help-social-media-to-prosecute-people-seeking-abortions-2023-2?r=US&IR=T">Google and Facebook</a> (among others) positional data is used to arrest women and young girls for having abortions in the United States, something which I consider a human right. There's also no telling how said companies will act if more anti-trans laws are passed, such as in Florida.</p>
    <p>That's why I'm deleting all of my content from Reddit, and why I'm looking into doing the same with Facebook and Google. Sadly, the latter two seem to be much harder in this modern world.</p>
    <p>I highly recommend that you do the same. What gives Reddit it's value is the userbase. Not the website.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why Reddit not providing an automated way to delete your content is bullshit.</h2>
    <p>Reddit is an asshat company. They provide no way to automatically delete all your content, and deleting your account only changes your username to "u/deleted" instead of actually deleting your posts and comments. This is bad for several reasons:</p>
    <p>Firstly, it's a very dangerous practice which may endanger people. If you're a trans person who at some point has shared PII (personally identifiably information) on Reddit and later come out as trans online and not in real life, this information might get leaked. For some of us this won't be the biggest deal. Perhaps the coming out became easier because now you didn't have to do anything. But that is not the case for more conservative countries.</p>
    <p>Had this happened for someone who lives in the Middle East, that might be the end of their life. If this happens to someone who lives in a neighbourhood with violent transphobes, they might get beat up pretty damn hard. And if you have parents that aren't supportive who find out about this, there's even a chance for domestic abuse.</p>
    <p>All of these are pretty graphic examples, but none are un-realistic in any way. Trans folks are still public enemy number one for lots of people, and especially an increasing amount of conservatives in the United States who want to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/cpac-speaker-transgender-people-eradicated-1234690924/">eradicate</a> trans people. See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">fascism</a>.</p>
    <p>But this isn't only bad for trans and other marginalized people. It's also bad for you.</p>
    <p>I think we've all said some stuff we've later regretted. Be it something which came out weird like Linus Tech Tips with his <a href="https://youtu.be/MFDiuBomSuY">hard r</a>-quote or something we genuinely find disgusting today, such as my personal use for the r-slur online back in the day we might one day just want it gone. We've all done bad stuff which we've grown from, and the first step to getting better is to right our wrongs. In this case, that might be deleting these posts and comments.</p>
    <p>If you have thousands of comments, and automated way makes this much easier for you to do. Instead of manually clicking "Delete" and "Confirm" a million times, you just click "delete everything between 01.01.2015 and 01.01.2018" (or similar) and "yes, do as I say!" and boom. You're done. Wrongs have been righted. Easy as that, makes it possible for everyone to do. But if you have to delete literally everything by hand, less people will choose to do so.</p>
    <p>It's also a right that at least every European and every Californian has under the GDPR and CCPR; the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/">Right to be Forgotten</a>. Reputation management is one of the main reasons for this, alongside Privacy protection and Personal growth. It's so important that law regulators have decided to force companies to do it at ones request.</p>
    <p>It's completele bullshit that Reddit not only doesn't provide and auto-deletion, but also <a href="https://youtu.be/mfZKkUg8jgM">restores deleted posts and comments</a>, something which <i>really</i> seems to break both the GDPR and CCPA. This is really noteworthy as Reddit is based in Californa, the state which <i>made</i> the CCPA.</p>
    <p>Luckily, there are stil ways to (semi-)automatically delete your content on reddit (at least until they restore it) </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Semi-automaticaly deleting your content.</h2>
    <p>As always, nerds on the internet have found a solution and a workaround. My personal recommendation is <a href="https://www.guidingtech.com/how-to-delete-all-reddit-comments-posts/">this</a>.</p>
    <p>A brief summary of it is as follows:</p>
    <li>1. Install the Reddit Enhancement Suite to your browser.</li>
    <li>2. Open <a href="https://old.reddit.com">old.reddit.com</a>.</li>
    <li>3. Click on your profile. Click on submitted for your posts or comments for your comments. This works for deleting both.</li>
    <li>4. Open your developer console. You can Right click > Inspect element > Console or use a shortcut. On Firefox, this shortcut is F12 > Console.</li>
    <li>5. In the console, paste the following snippet: var $domNodeToIterateOver = $('.del-button .option .yes'),    currentTime = 0,    timeInterval = 1500; $domNodeToIterateOver.each(function() {   var _this = $(this);  currentTime = currentTime + timeInterval;   setTimeout(function() {    _this.click();  }, currentTime);});</li>
    <li>6. Press arrow key up and run it again once you've deleted a full page. Sadly you have to re-run it for each page.</li>
    <br>    
    <h2>What to do after deleting your content.</h2>
    <p>The great thing about deleting your content is that you don't necessarily have to delete your account as well (although this is what I recommend). You can still keep all your subscriptions, follows and even your karma after your posts have been deleted and continue to enjoy Reddit (or what's left of it). However if you want to make sure that this stays deleted, you should probably head into your profile in a week or so and see if your content has been restored. This is what happened to me and many other users.</p>
    <p>However, if you want to delete your account, you should consider <a href="https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request">requesting all your user data</a> and <a href="https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">requesting</a> that it be deleted, preerably under CCPA or GDPR if those apply to you. History tells us that Reddit doesn't give a shit, but it's better than not doing anything.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Finishing thoughts</h2>
    <p>As Reddit falls, more and more people are looking for alternatives. Personally, I don't think I'll be finding any alternatives; instead I should pick up hobbies such as reading and programming as they are better for me. But if you are looking for alternatives, I can highly recommend the Fediverse. Sign up for an account on <a href="https://kbin.pub/en">KBin</a> or <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/">Lemmy</a> if you want a Reddit-like experience, and maybe check out Mastodon, Pixelfed, Pleroma, Akkoma, and other Fediverse-software if you enjoy it.</p>
    <p>I'm not a Fediverse-expert, so instead I'll recommend you guys to check out <a href="https://fedi.tips/">fedi.tips</a>. This blog is much better than me here. And if you decide to join the Fediverse, feel free to follow me on @runarcn@mstdn.social.</p>
