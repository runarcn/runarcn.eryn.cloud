    <p>What you're referring to as Mastodon, is in fact, the Fediverse/Mastodon, or as I've recently taken to calling it, the Fediverse plus Mastodon. Mastodon is not a social network unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning federated system made useful by the ActivityPub protocol, web utilities, and vital social network components comprising a full fediverse. </p> 
    
    <p>Many social media users communicate through a modified version of the Fediverse system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of the Fediverse which is widely used today is often called "Mastodon", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Fediverse system, developed by the open-source community. There really is a Mastodon, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
    
    <p>Mastodon is the social network platform: the program in the system that allows users to interact with each other. The platform is an essential part of the Fediverse, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete federated system. Mastodon is normally used in combination with other federated platforms, such as Pixelfed, PeerTube, and many others, all of which together form the Fediverse/Mastodon. All the so-called "Mastodon" instances are really instances of Fediverse/Mastodon.</p>
