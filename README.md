# IMPORTANT
THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ARCHIVED AS OF 24.09.2023
I've migrated over to [runarcn.no](blog.runarcn.no) and therefore have no need for this anymore. I'll keep it as an archive in case I want to look at it again in like 20 years.

Again, huge thanks to [Eryn](https://github.com/hericiumvevo) for free hosting and amazing service. They're an absolute legend, and you should really check out their website [blahaj.land](https://blahaj.land).

# About this project
This is a hobby project I'm running in order to (1) have a webpage because apparently all the kool kids do and (2) get a general understanding of web development, HTML, CSS and git.

Big thanks to [Eryn](https://github.com/hericiumvevo) for free hosting on https://eryn.cloud (cool website check it out)

Also, I test in production
