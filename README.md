# About this project
This is a hobby project I'm running in order to (1) have a webpage because apparently all the kool kids do and (2) get a general understanding of web development, HTML, CSS and git.

Big thanks to [Eryn](https://github.com/hericiumvevo) for free hosting on https://eryn.cloud (cool website check it out)

Also, I test in production
